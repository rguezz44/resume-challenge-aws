CLOUD RESUME CHALLENGE BY CARLOS RODRIGUEZ

Here is my presentation for my Cloud Resume Challenge for AWS. The challenge is a multi-step project that showcases your skills in cloud fundamentals. I had no prior Dev-Ops experience prior to taking on the project which made this that much more challenging but also well worth the experience.

The Architecture used in AWS included: -S3 -Lambda -CloudFront -Route53 -DynamoDB

Other programming languages/tools used included: -HTML -CSS -Javascript -API -Python -Git -Github & Github Actions -Terraform

Thank you. Any feedback will be greatly appreciated!
